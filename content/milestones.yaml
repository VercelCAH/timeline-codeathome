     You did some nice work and now is the time to show off! After you've finished your project, today you will officially submit it to us for review.

     **The deadline for submitting your project is the 31th March 2021, 11 PM Cest (GMT/UTC +02:00)!**

     **Submit your project via our Submission Typeform (to be published soon).**

     #There you can also add a presentation video, powerpoint, demo, prototype, etc. (depending on your solution). You can also submit aÂ **link to your GitHub repository.** This is not only beneficial for us but also for you, since you can directly refer to your work later on when you want to show it off to anyone.
     #If you have any further questions we encourage you to read carefully our Project Guide including **[the Submission notion page](https://www.notion.so/techlabs/codeathome-Project-Submission-ebdc9c9a1ac74c83b295d256a835118e)**.
