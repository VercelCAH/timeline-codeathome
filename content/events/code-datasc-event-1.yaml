    Do you want to learn how to apply your new learned Data Science skills?

    This **live Coding Event** is for all **Pythonistas and Data Scientists** but also for all interested Techies from the other tracks!

    Got the basic data science skills stacked up but you are still unsure on HOW to use them to tackle your project?
    
    DonÂ´t worry!
    
    This live coding event is here to showcase how a data analyst/scientist tackles analytically complex problems with the instruments you have learned. It will give you a grasp on how to "think of" and "plan" data science analyses and how to implement your plan into a best practice code.
    This event is meant for all techies who have learned the track content preferably up to Exploratory Data Analysis with Seaborn. 
    Duration is 90 minutes, consisting of 45 minutes of live coding plus 45 minutes Q&A session about your project.
    *Do I have to code along? * - Nope, just sit back and enjoy the show!
    We will replicate an analysis which was presented as a final Data Science bootcamp project once!
    Stay tuned!
