    With this event, we will **officially kick-off the project phase**. Main points will be a recap of how the project phase works, how you can build a successful projects, how to communicate effectively and why project management is so important. 
    
    Furthermore, we will give 3 project groups the chance to pitch their ideas and share their project vision during the Kick-off event. You will get 10 min to pitch your idea and explain the audience you want to achieve your project goals. Afterwards you will get valuable feedback from the #codeathome team and the community.
    More information will follow.
