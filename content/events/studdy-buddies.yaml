    In our Buddies Pairing Event, you will have the chance to meet your TrackStudy-Buddies for the following weeks. In your TrackStudy-Buddy Group, you will be able to discuss your track, clarify questions, and exchange about your progress. By asking you to be part of a group, we encourage you to use this Bootcamp not only to learn tech skills but also to interact with people from all around the globe and build friendships beyond borders. This is your chance to connect with like-minded people and keep each other motivated!

    Agenda for the evening:
    
    - Presentation of the TrackStudy-Buddies program
    - Get to know your Buddies Group
    - Discuss your goals and expectations for the following weeks
    - Final get together within the group with fun games

    Your TrackStudy-Buddies group will be your biggest help for the following weeks and make the experience even more memorable. Don't miss this opportunity!
